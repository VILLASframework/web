        Welcome to <b>DT-FPEN</b>!
      </p>
      <p>The DT concept for electrical networks is based on the simulation tool DPSim, and allows the interconnection
        to data acquisition devices (measurement devices and status indicators) and the interaction with other systems.</p>

      <p>It is possibile to interconnect with other systems, like the service for Data-driven management of surplus RES generation 
        where forecasts for the consumers in low voltage are calculated, or that can be used for predicting the consumption 
        of the water pumps in the circuit of the pilot. This will allow the pilot to improve their usage of the flexibility capabilities.</p>
